4. The trouble is **that the part** of the recent acceleration is due to the usual rebound that occurs at this point in a business cycle, **and so not conclusive evidence** of a revival in the underlying trend.

**句子分析**

第一个that引导了一个很长的**表语从句**，表语从句由两个分句组成，第一个分句中又有一个that引导的定语从句**that occurs at this point in a business cycle** 用于修饰rebound，第二个分句和第一个分句有共同的主语**the part of the recent acceleration**

**the touble is thar part of accereration **is due to rebound**, **and not conclusive evidence**.

**句子翻译**
> 问题在于最近加速发展的部分是由于商业圈在这个时间段通常会发生的反弹，所以这**并不能构成潜在趋势复苏的最终证据** 。
